# JSmod JavaScript MOD player
(c) 2011-2015 atbrask@gmail.com

Once upon a time I implemented a simple module player in Java. Then Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox got proper Javascript audio support, and naturally I went ahead and ported my code to run in a browser. Fast forward a couple of years, and now it seems that all major browser vendors actually agree on the audio API! Even the new Microsoft Edge browser is supposed to support it (I haven't tested JSmod on that one, though). Luckily, they went for the less ugly proposal (the webkit one).

It works correctly most of the time. I only have one or two mods that sound slightly off for whatever reason (this is also an issue with the original Java version). Also, I never got around to implement an actual UI. The UI also glitches a bit sometimes if you change songs while it's playing. So YMMV.. :-)

I might finish it some day, but who knows...

Happy hacking! Enjoy!
